## HI ðŸ‘‹

I make a ton of open-source software, in a few seemingly-random areas of interest (music, data, web, radio, hacking, games) with lots of programming languages. I am fluent & productive in over 100, but for practical reasons, I tend to stick to just a few (favorites right now are javascript, python, nim, lua, and plain C.)

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate: making music, programming-tools and accessible hacking-tools (especially for kids/education.)

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Whatever you like. If I am feeling like I don't have time, I may not answer or be a bit gruff, but I do enjoy helping people with their projects. Don't take it personal if I don't get right back. I'm pretty busy.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: [node-raylib](https://github.com/RobLoach/node-raylib), [null0](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0), [crossaudio](https://konsumer.js.org/crossaudio/), [nuked](https://github.com/konsumer/nuked), [pntr](https://github.com/robloach/pntr), [null-units](https://github.com/konsumer/null-units) and probably a lot more
